SnipR
=====
**`Server Network IP Resolver`** : Firefox addon to geolocate webservers.


Description
===========
SnipR provides the most light and minimal interface to quick-lookup the Geolocation of the website's hosting servers upto city level precision. It also provides some other relevant details such as the server *IP*, *Timezone* and *Google Maps* plot of the location data.

Total timeout for hideous web-servers!

P.S: the `whois` feature that comes with **v4.0.0** is experimental as of now. It's getting there - but, please don't rely on it just yet!


Installation
============
Get **SnipR** on your Mozilla browser from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/snipr). You will need to restart the browser for the addon to take effects.

Version update is automatic & the browser will show the update notification.
