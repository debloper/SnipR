  <h1>SnipR</h1>
    <p><strong><cite style="font-size:large;">Server Network IP Resolver</cite></strong> : Firefox &amp; Fennec addon to geolocate webservers.</p>
<br />
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>SnipR provides the most light and minimal interface to quick-lookup the Geolocation of the website's hosting servers upto city level precision. It also provides some other relevant details such as the server <em>IP</em>, <em>Timezone</em> and <em>Google Maps</em> plot of the location data.</p>
    <p>Total timeout for hideous web-servers!</p>
<br />
  <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Get <strong>SnipR</strong> on your Mozilla browser from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/snipr/">addons.mozilla.org</a>. You will need to restart the browser for the addon to take effects.</p>
    <p>Version update is automatic &amp; the browser will show the update notification.</p>
<br />
  <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <p>As the forking &amp; merging of SnipR &amp; SnipR Mobile has been streamlined into one <strong>SnipR</strong> repository, it took some reworking in versioning convention. Now featurewise, SnipR 1.x.0 = SnipR Mobile 1.x.5 upto version 1.2.5.</p>

  <h2>Roadmap / Bug Reports</h2>
    <p>Personally I don't really think of any more features that has to be integrated.</p>
    <p>May you have any, please report them as <a href="https://github.com/debloper/SnipR/issues" title="Issues Tracker">features/suggestions/bugs</a>.</p>
<br />
  <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <p>I have got complains that the button is not prominent enough to be eye-catchy - some even said they failed to find it completely after installing. Odd to say, but it's made to be like this. It's meant to blend itself with Firefox's interface, and to be an integral part of it. In Fennec, I guess, there's less chance for it - I am also not very happy to put the icon on where it is - wish I knew any better place.</p>
    <p>Also some people complained the absence of marker(pointer) on the map [Personally, I don't like the marker] - what do you think?</p>
