Known Issues
============
I have got complains that the button is not prominent enough to be eye-catchy - some even said they failed to find it completely after installing. Odd to say, but it's made to be like this. It's meant to blend itself with Firefox's interface, and to be an integral part of it. In Fennec, I guess, there's less chance for it - I am also not very happy to put the icon on where it is - wish I knew any better place.

I also have complaints about the minimal zoom level and the absence of marker(pointer) on the map [I personally don't like the marker] - let me know your opinion.
